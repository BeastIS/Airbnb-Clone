The website that we are about to clone is https://airbnb.com

This is a demo project for understanding how to use HTML, CSS and Bootstrap to build a website of your own.

raw.html is a HTML page that uses only HTML, no CSS is involved.

inline.html is a HTML page that uses HTML along with inline CSS.

internal.html is similar to inline.html, but all styling is maintained in head section using style tag.

bootstrap.html is a HTML which uses HTML, external css named "custom.css" and bootstrap 4 which gives the real feel of the website looks.
